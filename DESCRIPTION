Description: Bayesian estimation and prediction for stochastic processes based
    on the Euler approximation. Considered processes are: jump diffusion,
    (mixed) diffusion models, hidden (mixed) diffusion models, non-homogeneous
    Poisson processes (NHPP), (mixed) regression models for comparison and a
    regression model including a NHPP.
